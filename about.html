<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a 22 years old web developer hoping to leverage my abilities by working
  in a reputed company. I graduated from Seneca College Of Applied Arts and
  Technology in Computer programming diploma. I learned a lot about programming
  languages such as C, C++, html, JavaScript, python and project management.

  If I talk about my journey in this particular field, So, earlier I used to be
  a medical student back home in India but when I came to Canada in 2021, I
  enrolled in Computer Programming Course which was quite a daunting task for me
  as I did not had any previous experience in this field. But slowly, I realised
  that I am developing my interest in learning these programming language. I
  find html a piece of cake for me but when it comes to languages like C and C++
  then I really have to put a lot of efforts.

  Talking about my hobbies, then I really like to workout and lifting weights.
  other than that, I am a really good cook and I love to try dishes from
  different cuisines but still for me, Indian food is the best food.
